* Advent of code 2024
At some point, this repository will probably contain the solution to the
[[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code 2024]].

* Downloading input and sample files
I added automatic fetching of the full input as well as the samples (see
[[https://github.com/dschrempf/aoc24/blob/main/app/Fetch.hs][Fetch.hs]]). For example,
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
cabal run fetch 1    # Fetch full input of day one.
cabal run fetch 1 1  # Fetch sample one of day one.
#+END_SRC
